geoclue (0.11.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Craig Andrews ]
  * Fix warnings reported by lintian
  * Resolve circular dependency between geoclue and libgeoclue0
    (Closes: #520129). libgeoclue no longer depends on geoclue.
    libgeoclue instead suggests geoclue.
  * Changed --libexecdir to point to /usr/lib/geoclue.
    (Closes: #518822).
  * Use cdbs (Thanks Stefan Jenkner <stefan@jenkner.org>)
  * Added debian/watch for update detection
  * Thanks Bernd Zeimetz <bzed@debian.org> for the previous NMU
    (Closes: #518586)
  * Install examples as examples in the libgeoclue-dev package

  [ Bernd Zeimetz ]
  * Adding myself to Uploaders.
  * Bumping Standards-Version to 3.8.1, no changes needed.
  * Add dependency on geoclue for location providers where
    it was missing.
  * Raise build-dependency on libgammu-dev to >= 1.24.0 as
    we're applying a patch which needs the API change.
  * Update Vcs information in to point to git.debian.org.
  * Add debian/gbp.conf to make sure we use pristine-tar.
